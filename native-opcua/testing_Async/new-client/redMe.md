This code is an example of how to use the opcua library in Python to read and write values from an OPC UA server.

The opcua library is imported at the beginning of the code, along with the asyncio and time libraries.

The code defines three functions: read_input_value(), write_value_int(), and write_value_bool(). These functions are used to read and write integer and boolean values from and to the OPC UA server.

In the main function, a connection is established to the OPC UA server using the Client class from opcua. The get_root_node() method is used to get the root node of the server, and the read_input_value() function is called to read the value of a particular node in the OPC UA server.

The write_value_bool() function is also called to write a boolean value to a particular node in the OPC UA server.

Finally, the connection to the OPC UA server is closed using the disconnect() method of the Client class. The execution time of the code is also printed using the time library.

Note that there is a typo in the code. The client object is instantiated with the address opc.tcp://192.168.0.1:4840, but later the code tries to connect to an object named assclient. This should be changed to client.
